    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup fine sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>3½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
        <li>2 litres of vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky. Return dough to the bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Press dough down gently. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent dough from drying.</li>
        <li>Roll 1 dough ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter; cover with a cloth. Repeat with remaining dough balls.</li>
        <li>Heat 2-inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry dough in hot oil until puffed, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip dough and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
    </ol>
